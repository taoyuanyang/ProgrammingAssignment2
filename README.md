There are functions to solve matrix inversion problem.
Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some benefit to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than compute it repeatedly.The following functions are used to create special object to store a numeric vector and cache's its mean and it can improve the computation efficiency.the function creates a special objext that store its inverse.Write a short comment describing this functionThe following function calculates the mean of the special "matrix" created with the above function. However, it first checks to see if the mean has already been calculated. If so, it gets the mean from the cache and skips the computation.Otherwise, it calculates the mean of the data and sets the value of the mean in the cache via the setmean function.
